# 🖌️ VizArt Computer Vision Drawing Platform

Art of course, is the primary method we have for expressing ourselves. To enhance what’s possible with computer vision and to allow for a new level of artistic expression, we designed the VizArt platform. 

Our primary motivation is to make good gifts for our friends and family to use in their everyday life. ***We imagine a world where people interact with both the physical and digital world creatively.*** We began by engineering and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible with the current artificial intelligence technologies of customizable deep learning, streaming media, and AR.

Air writing is made possible with the use of hand gestures, including a pen gesture to indicate when to draw and an eraser gesture to remove lines. Using VizArt, you can bring your ideas to life by sketching in the air.

Our computer vision algorithm makes it possible for you to interact with the world with a colour picker gesture and even a snipping tool to manipulate real world objects.

The features I listed above are cool! But, what use are these features if you couldn’t share these drawings with your friends? Hence, we built a platform for you to share your drawings and access others drawings!

I hope you will you enjoy using VizArt and share with your friends. 

Make good art.
